# copy-files
copy files with in common folders

This PowerShell script compares and finds common folders between two specified locations (by defualt from D: to F:) and finds missing files in the target location but available in the root directory and then copies them over to the target directory without affecting files available in the target directory and not available in the root directory. Please note that administrator privileges may be required for some certain directories as expected.
